A 30 Day Chart Challenge to improve my data visualizations.

Welcome to the 30 Day Chart Challenge! This repository contains guidelines, images, and resources for each day.

## Challenge Overview

The 30-Day Chart Challenge is a personal data visualization challenge designed to help improve my data visualization skills and create a portfolio of charts and graphs. Each day, I'll create a different data visualization based on a new challenge.
